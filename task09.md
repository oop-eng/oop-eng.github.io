1) Make a new Eclipse project called `task09` or similar.

2) Make a **List** of 10 [Circle](shapes0/Circle.java) objects. Use a random radius. Keep adding circles to the list until `Math.random()` returns less than `0.5`. Then, iterate over the list and print each area.

3) Make a **Map** that associates the following employee **IDs** with **names**. Make test cases where you test several valid and invalid *IDâ€™s* and print the associated *name*.

| ID    | Name          |
|------:|:--------------|
| a1234 | Steve Jobs    |
| a1235 | Scott McNealy |
| a1236 | Jeff Bezos    |
| a1237 | Larry Ellison |
| a1238 | Bill Gates    |

> **Hint:** Keys and values of *Maps* can be any `Object` type, so in real life you would probably have the key be a `String` and the associated value be a *Person* or *Employee* object.
>
> **Hint:** To make things simpler on this exercise, you can use `String` for both the *ID* and the *name*, rather than bothering to create a *Person* or *Employee* class. The point here is to associate *keys* with *values*, then retrieve *values* later based on *keys*.

4) Go back to the previous problem and make your lookup method work with keys in any case. For example, both `a1234` and `A1234` should match `Steve Jobs`.

5) Make a **Map** that associates numbers (e.g., `2`) with words (e.g, `two` or `dos`). Test the Map out by passing in a few ints and printing out the corresponding words.

## Extra

6) Do some timing tests to verify the performance claims regarding the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList for accessing the middle element.

> **Hint:** Use `System.currentTimeMillis` or `System.nanoTime` to lookup the current time. Compute a delta and divide to get an elapsed time in seconds.
>
> **Hint:** To ensure meaningful results, use very long lists and access the middle element many times.
>
> **Hint:** Run several tests, each with larger and larger lists.
