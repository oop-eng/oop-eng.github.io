## Final Task

Phonebook.

Create a Java program to store and process customer data:

- Name, surname (`String`, the first letter is uppercase and the rest are lowercase).
- Phone numbers (array or collection of `String`, e.g. "+380661234567").
- Registration date (`String`, in the format: "yyyy.mm.dd").

## Requirements

1) Create your own generic collection based on an *array* or *linked list*. Or you can use classes from the [Java Collections Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/).

2) Demonstrate the following operations:

- Add a customer.
- Delete a customer by name and surname.
- Show all customers.
- Sort and print all customers by surname and name.
- Search customer by phone numbers.
- Search customer by name and surname.
- Search customer by registration date.

## Extra

1) Validate input data with [regular expressions](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html).

2) Save and load the customer collection to/from a file.

> **Hint:** You can implement your own algorithm for writing and reading customer data to/from a file or use convenient Java SE technologies such as *Serialization of Java objects*:
>	- [Oracle: Java Object Serialization](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/serialization/examples/index.html);
>	- [Tutorials Point: Java - Serialization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_serialization.htm);
>	- [GeeksforGeeks: Serialization and Deserialization in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialization-in-java/);
> or [Long Term Persistence](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/advanced/longpersistence.html) for [JavaBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans).

3) Create a text menu or [JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/user-interface-tutorial/) GUI to implement the operations shown above.
